John P. Skinner Jr. is an Associate Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services(AWS). He has always focused on bringing advanced technologies to the masses. It has been his personal goal to help develop and spread new cutting edge technologies.

### Areas of Focus
**Game Technology**

John has always been interested in the realm of video game creation. As part of his Computer Science degree at Murray State University, John developed his own game; Valdoris: Hordes from Below. Though it never saw a public release, this was one step of many that would fuel John's love of video games and their creation. John plans to join the Games Industry Technical Field Community at AWS to further his expertise in the field.

**Internet of Things** 

Technology is a tool to assist people in making thier lives better. John has always been facinated by the prospect of bringing technology into peoples homes and buisness with custom built tools to make life easier. Throughout his journey through the field of Computer Science, physical technological devices have always intrigued him. John plans to utilize the AWS framework of IoT to better understand this field and perhaps look to specialize in this area.

**Analytics** 

Before joining AWS, John never focused on Analytics as an interest field but he was intrigued by how data effects society. Now, having been immersed in analytics at AWS, John plans to expand his knowledge of the subject and maybe become a subject matter expert. John is currently working on a project that has a major focus on analytics. John plans to expand his knowledge in the area as he goes into his first full year at AWS.

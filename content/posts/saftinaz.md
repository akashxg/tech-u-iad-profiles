### Projects

**Fifa Analysis**

A brief analysis on player data from Fifa 2019.  The dataset was found here: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19.  We designed a machine learning pipeline to classify players by their role on offense, defense, midfield, or goalkeeper.  There are a lot of positions on the field, so we were able to get better accuracy by condensing positions to role.  We also identify the most defining features to the role.

**Hip Hop Basketball Mentions**

I scrape hip hop lyrics to find how often rappers mention basketball players.  I use AWS Comprehend to extract names.  Not entirely complete.

**N-back**
N back is a game that lets you practice your working memory capacity by memorizing a sequence of squares and marking if the next square in the sequence matches the square that lit up N squares ago.

### About Richard
**Education**
Hofstra University 2019 | Bachelor of Science - CyberSecurity  
  
**Personal Statement**
I started at AWS in July entering into the TechU program slotting into the Professional Services Consultant role.  Having a background in CyberSecurity and low level programming meant that I had to go through a big transition to higher level cloud concepts.  It isn't all about tech and computers, fitness and health has become a massive part of my personal life.  This passion mixed with a drive to create has lead to projects that incorperate both. Back at Hofstra I worked in a computer repair center, I worked my way up to Senior Technician through being there for customers when they needed help while also providing the best service.  That same mindset led me to Amazon.  Customer Obsession is the foundation of everything we do and i'm proud to be a part of that.

**Personal** 

Facial recongition for online testing  | Python application | https://github.com/RichieLawless/Design2019  
While online testing is more convenient you can't for sure know whos taking the test without a live video feed.  Live video feeds require large amount of overhead a person to sit on the other end watching you or in some cases a class of people.  
The solution is to have a plugin that loads a user profile that has multiple pictures of the user stored, then at the time of test launch and finish take a picture.  At test launch the system would use choose a random time frame to snap pictures and then analyze them at the end of the test against the user profile.  This would stop the system from being predictable.  If there system is uncertain if it is the desired user then it would throw a flag for human review.  
  
Working on using AWS Rekognition and making this a cloud native application.
